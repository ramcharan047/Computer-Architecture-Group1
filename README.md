## Question 1: Signed Binary Arithmetic

A Python program to perform signed binary addition using 8-bit 2's complement representation.

Expressions:
1. 25 + (+18)
2. (-25) + (-18)

The program displays the 8-bit binary operands, binary addition, final binary and decimal result, carry-out, and signed arithmetic overflow status.

### Expected results

| Expression | 8-bit result | Decimal result | Overflow |
|---|---|---:|---|
| 25 + (+18) | 00101011 | 43 | No |
| (-25) + (-18) | 11010101 | -43 | No |

## Question 2: Logical Shift Operations

A Python program to perform logical shifts on 8-bit binary numbers.

Operations:
1. Logical left shift of `10110110` by 2 positions.
2. Logical right shift of `11010100` by 2 positions.

The program displays the original number, each shift step, and the final 8-bit result.

### Expected results

| Operation | Final 8-bit result |
|---|---|
| Left shift `10110110` by 2 | `11011000` |
| Right shift `11010100` by 2 | `00110101` |
